Spirros & The Mantle
====================

Power comes from within and without.

Within you is the wellspring of willpower and wisdom that makes you a wizard, from which you summon your SPIRROS: the raw sparks of power with whom you will work wonders.

The MANTLE you choose enfolds you from without.  It is the lens through which you focus your power, and each shapes your magic in its own unique way.  Will you work your magic with the CROWN OF WINTER, or the RAIMENT OF FLAMES?  The EYE OF MINDS or the SCARS OF AGONY, or any of a hundred more?
